1. Text inputs have a value property that holds the current content of the input. Moreover, an input can be cleared by setting the value back to ''.
2. To delete todos, you'll need to add an event listener for the click event of each delete button. However, you don't want to just delete the button; you need to also delete its parent container.
3. To delete an element's parent, you can use element.parentNode.remove(), calling the remove method on the parent node of the element.
4. In an event listener callback, such as the one needed for the delete button click event, you can reference the element using the this keyword (assuming you don't use an arrow function).
